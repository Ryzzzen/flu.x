# Manaflux server
> This project is a work in progress.

This program will allow [Manaflux](https://github.com/ryzzzen/manaflux) to be faster, because Manaflux users will automatically upload data (such as perks, itemsets etc) to the server
and return this data when necessary (for someone else for example). It's like another provider (like OP.GG, ChampionGG..), but this project is intended to make Manaflux even more fast and reliable,
and will prevent more errors from happening (for example if a website is down).

## Built with
